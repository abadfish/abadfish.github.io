Hello, World!
-------------------------------
I am proud to introduce my very first CLI Gem-in-the-making: Matadore.
For instruction on how to use Matadore I have put together this short video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV3-VFag160&feature=youtu.be">Using Matadore</a>.

>The website I am currently using to mine data from is the <a href=" http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=40.781581302919285&lon=-73.96648406982422">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association</a>,
 with the latitude and longitude being deciphered by Matadore based on input from the user.

Well, here it is. My first contact with the ruby programming public is with this CLI gem, Matadore.
This project was a TON of fun for me. Once I finally did start, I couldn't stop until I was done. I literally wrote the whole program in 13 hours straight with little or no regard for the need to eat!
But, there are a few things I'd like to touch on regarding the making of this gem and what I learned about myself as a programmer. After all, I am a student, and that's what this project is all about - LEARNING!
First off, I, admittedly, was afraid of it. This was my first experience without the training wheels of my educational program -Learn- and I kicked tires for about a week before I actually began.

But then, I asked myself why all the other students I am the track with are doing it and I'm not. Sure, it's hard, but it should be. And just like that I was programming it with a great will and near obsession. Characteristics, I might add, that are brought to life for me by coding, and what I love most about it. What did I learn? Start. No matter what. Just start. I also gained some confidence in myself. Programming and finding the way is a puzzle. And puzzles are fun! Not scary. As far as the academic aspect of this project, I gained first-hand understanding of object oriented ruby and leveled-up my ability to be nimble with it.

So, now that I've given you my personal side of things regarding this project, I'll get down to business.
The idea for this gem came about when discussing with my dad how he gets his information for planning an ocean race. He's a navigator and has to compile data from many websites as well as software to plan his routes. I thought well, here's an idea for me. There's obviously a gap here to fill in technology and I have the resource of someone that can actually use it. While Matador is only in its infancy as a tool for navigators I took the opportunity of this project to get started on the larger goal - to build better software for navigators.

To get started, install by running (terminal)
```
gem install matadore
```

Then run
```
matadore
```
