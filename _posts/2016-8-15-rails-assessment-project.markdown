My Rails Assessment Project: World Macro
-------------------------------
It's true what they say about the trajectory of learning to code. In summary, it's easy, then it's hard, then it's really hard, and then it gets real. I've just planted myself well into the real phase by working on my Rails assessment project and I can tell you, my mental fitness is at a level I'm pretty happy about and I've learned things I never could have even scratched the surface of without it.

Anyway, the idea for this project was born out of the request from an old boss to build a blog app for him to spread around his trade ideas and start discussion. I took the idea and let myself really run with it and for the first time since starting this journey, wrapped my heart around it and made something that I'm actually proud of. Idea upon idea sprung up as I was building and the app now has 9 models and counting.

Since I would rather demonstrate than talk about what I've made (plus I've been working on this far too long to make a short blog post about) I'm going to keep this post short and sweet.

For instruction on how to use World Macro I have put together this short video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9-zRXJ4Uv4&feature=youtu.be">World Macro Walk-Through</a>.

If you'd like to take a look at the code or offer suggestions please do so on <a href="https://github.com/abadfish/world-macro-rails">GitHub.</a>
