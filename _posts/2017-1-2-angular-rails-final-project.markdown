How Angular brought me to my knees...and then shot me into the fourth dimension
-------------------------------

This is not going to be a technical post. I will certainly follow up with one, but this one is going to tell a story of small victories in reflection of adding AngularJS to my stack.

AngularJS was the final unit of the Flatiron School's online full-stack program. I had seen a cartoon about Angular describing a roller-coastered sequence of feelings toward the Javascript-based framework and wondered what exactly that was all about. It definitely made approaching it more intimidating.

Being that Angular was the last unit in the program however, I approached it with vigor, eager to start my new career as a programmer, and planning to power through it. But it didn't happen that way. It didn't happen even remotely that way.

AngularJS powered through me.

I have this (learned) instinct of needing to be effective and efficient, something I am quite sure is the product of my former experience on trading desks. Whomever delivers faster gets the chicken dinner and there is no second place. I learned to scan the news and markets for clues to participant actions and make my forecasts effectively. There was adrenaline involved and a panic-like urgency to deliver.

That has no place here. That habit had to be destroyed as a programmer. In fact, as a programmer, quite the opposite is necessary and in my quest to conquer Angular, Angular conquered my need to brute-force efficiency.

Now I'm not saying that I hadn't already learned that lesson in studying prior languages. I found this out years ago with VBA and then Ruby refreshed my memory. Concepts need to be broken down into molecular form, documentation read thoroughly, and google-foo honed masterfully. For me, this takes a centered mind, sometimes a few deep breaths, and enough sleep. Any intense feelings, such as frustration need to be squashed, and are otherwise extremely counter-productive.

I, like most, do not change until something shows itself as uncomfortable or not working for me anymore. It's only then that we know a change needs to be made. But this one didn't come easily for me. It seemed the more I tried to jam Angular into my brain, the less I knew and the more devastatingly frustrated I became. Admittedly, there were even a few days where I cried actual tears and questioned my decision to become a programmer. I would learn a concept and then apply it, only to have it broken by the next one. I begged Angular for mercy.

And then it became uncomfortable enough to change, to examine deeply why I was struggling with Angular. I had to slow down. I had to go line by line through documentation, watch video tutorials, and rent space on StackOverflow. I had to get to know Angular intimately and fall in love with it. You can't force that. And now, I'm delighted to say, creating in Angular is satisfying.

I got over the wall. I got through the pain of changing my attitude towards learning to program. I have AngularJS to thank for that and I do believe that nasty habit of inviting adrenaline has left me.
