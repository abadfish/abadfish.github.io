How Angular brought me to my knees...and then shot me into the fourth dimension
-------------------------------

This is not going to be a technical post. I will certainly follow up with one directly after, but this one is going to tell a story of small victories.

AngularJS was the final unit of the Flatiron School's online full-stack program. I had seen cartoons and memes about Angular describing a roller-coastered sequence of feelings toward the Javascript-based framework wondered what exactly that was all about. It definitely made approaching it more intimidating.

Being that Angular was the last unit in the program, I approached it with vigor, eager to be finished and planning to power through it. But it didn't happen that way. It didn't happen even remotely that way.

AngularJS powered through me.
