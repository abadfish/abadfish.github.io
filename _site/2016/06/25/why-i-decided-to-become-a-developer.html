            <p><h2 id="the-motivation-work-doesnt-have-to-be-work">The Motivation: Work doesn’t have to be “work.”</h2>
<blockquote>

  <p>I am not one of those people who separates my personality from what it is that I do for work, and as a developer I don’t have to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s that saying, “If you like what you do, you never work a day in your life,” and well, I’ve worked and I have not worked.</p>

<p>It’s not like I have an aversion to the word “work” or that I don’t bust my butt when I have a goal, or a passion, or even an obligation. We all have to sometimes. I’m not a lazy person. In fact, I’ve been labeled quite the opposite.</p>

<p>But, I’ve experienced what its like to love what I do - to do something as a profession that I would do even if I weren’t getting paid for it, that isn’t tainted because I am. And I crave that. I have learned about myself that I am most content when I am accomplishing, that I like checking things off lists, setting goals and reaching them, or even just having a vision and blindly trusting that I am moving toward it because I’m working within one component of it.</p>

<p>I started my career in the financial industry right out of college and immediately a passion for my chosen field grew. I went early and stayed late, read and studied at night, and wished my weekends away because I couldn’t wait to get back to work. I was good at what I did and I wanted more. My passion and dedication was recognized by my superiors and they in turn helped me to succeed quickly. The first four years of my career were magical.</p>

<p>Then 2008 happened. At the time, I worked at the biggest bank in the world. They announced they would be reducing force by 100K people, which was 1/3 of their total. Those reductions would be made from all departments with fixed income, the area of business most affected and one facet of which most responsible, at the top of the list. My trading desk was dissolved and we were escorted out of the building. My heart was broken. Not only because I lost my job- there will always be other jobs- but because I was painfully aware of the magnitude of the situation, and how the industry as I knew it might never be the same again.</p>

<p>In the years to follow I remained in the industry working at a couple of hedge funds and a couple of boutique brokerage firms, but never to rediscover my passion for the work in spite of everything I tried. I mimicked the same behavior but it only wore me out and work progressively became “work.”</p>

<p>Until…I landed myself at this one particular fund. I was blessed with a boss who saw willingness in me and wanted to teach me something new, not to mention it would lighten his load. As one of his programs was written in Excel, he taught me VBA. I should mention I am using the word “taught” loosely - he would assign me something with only an expected result and expect me to figure it out on my own. And so I did. I learned how to write forms and process the input, to design algorithms and analyze their results, and eventually to write my own programs.</p>

<p>Passion for my work grew again and soon I was automating everything in the office that I could and starting to look outside of work to learn more about programming. I took some classes online at Codecademy, on Udemy, and was active in several forums. Finally, I decided I would pursue this new passion and started researching bootcamps. I left trading and got a job at a tech company so as to learn more about tech in general. I did know that I wasn’t getting hired at a software company with my VBA skills so I took the closest thing I could find.</p>

<p>I chose Learn Verified because of the culture and the flexibility. I was able to test whether or not I’d be able to handle the workload while still holding a job because of the prerequisite Ruby track required for admission. Doing that my motivation deepened and the culture of the school enveloped me.</p>

<p>So here I am, learning software development. I wake up early and stay up late. I code all weekend. And I never once have said to myself that I don’t feel like doing it. I think it would be unrealistic to believe that I will never feel like my work is work in the obligatory sense but so far that has been the case. I also don’t think I’m a rare breed when it comes to developers. The majority of them that I meet are as happy as I could ever want to be in a profession. I am not one of those people who separates my personality from what it is that I do for work, and as a developer I don’t have to.</p>

<p>Happy coding :)</p>
